                He who has never denied himself for the sake of giving, has but glanced at the joys of charity. He who
                has no charity deserves no mercy. Charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to become
                independent of it.

                As soon as you complete your donation, your gift will start its journey. First your money
                will be turned
                into food, and then sent to one of the over 80 countries where people are most vulnerable.<br> Every
                single
                day, WFP has 5,600 trucks,<br> 30 ships and nearly 100 planes ready to deliver the food you send.
                Because
                you can't go there and hand out the food yourself, we do it for you.

                    Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in the world. We have already made
                    incredible progress: there are 300 million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible
                    to end hunger. WFP is working for that every second of the day, feeding over 95 million people in
                    urgent need and implementing programmes that tackle the causes of hunger. But this work depends on
                    the support of people like you.

                    When families have nowhere else to turn, they can find sanctuary and support at the Red Door - moms
                    who have bravely fled abuse to keep their kids safe, refugees seeking sanctuary from war and
                    violence, and families in crisis with nowhere else to go.
                    Your support helps each family who comes through our doors to heal and build a brighter future.

                <p class="color">
                    Imagine life without the ability to read or do basic math. For 56% of elementary-aged children
                    around the world who don't meet minimum reading proficiency standards, the future can look bleak.
                    Together, we can do more than just get kids in the classroom â€” we can empower them for a brighter
                    future. Equipped with literacy and essential life skills, they can grow into adults who earn higher
                    wages, educate their own children, and have a voice in their community.
